# 3D Parametric and Generative Shapes: Design Specifications

This document outlines the design specifications for creating and displaying 3D shapes—including parametric or generative forms—with an emphasis on transformations, animation, and extendability.

## Scope

1. **Interactive 3D Environment**  
   - Must support windowing or a similar mechanism for rendering and user event handling.  
   - Should enable continuous rendering and provide a means to schedule or trigger periodic updates (e.g., at a target frame rate).

2. **Parametric or Generative 3D Shapes**  
   - Must allow the definition of shapes via mathematical equations or procedural generation.  
   - Should support both simple shapes (e.g., cubes) and more complex forms (e.g., spheres, tori, fractals).  
   - Vertices and indices should be generated or organized to reflect the shape geometry accurately.

3. **Transformations and Camera Control**  
   - Should include a concept of model, view, and projection transformations.  
   - Model matrix handles object-level transformations (position, rotation, scaling).  
   - View matrix represents camera positioning and orientation in the scene.  
   - Projection matrix defines perspective parameters, such as field of view, near plane, and far plane.  
   - The environment must allow updating these transformations dynamically, including window-resize events where the projection or viewport might change.

4. **Animation**  
   - Must support smoothly animated transformations over time (e.g., continuous rotation).  
   - The design should include a way to increment an angle or other parameters on each update.  
   - Rotations or movement should be adjustable and resettable if desired.

5. **Rendering Pipeline**  
   - Requires depth testing for correct 3D rendering.  
   - Should handle a pipeline that applies the model, view, and projection transforms to each vertex.  
   - Must support coloring schemes or other visual attributes of the rendered shapes.

6. **Extendability for More Shapes or Effects**  
   - The design must allow easy substitution of one shape for another (e.g., swapping a cube for a parametric sphere).  
   - Future shapes may include advanced geometry or fractal structures.  
   - Interaction features can be added for user-controlled transformations or parameter changes.  
   - Optional lighting and shading models (e.g., ambient, diffuse) can be integrated for realism.

## Potential Enhancements

1. **Lighting**  
   - May include simple or advanced lighting calculations in the rendering stage.  
   - A basic directional or ambient lighting approach can highlight surface contours.

2. **User Interaction**  
   - Possibility of keyboard or mouse controls to manipulate shape parameters (e.g., toggling rotation, switching shapes).  
   - Camera navigation (panning, zooming, rotating around objects) can be introduced.

3. **Procedural or Fractal Geometry**  
   - Shapes could be generated based on iterative algorithms or fractal formulas.  
   - Dynamic updates to geometry (e.g., real-time deformation) can be considered.

4. **Performance Optimization**  
   - As complexity grows, use efficient data structures for vertex and index management.  
   - Consider robust methods for handling large numbers of vertices or complex scenes.

## Summary

These specifications aim to create a flexible, interactive 3D environment that can render and animate parametric or generative shapes. Implementations should focus on:

- A clear separation of model, view, and projection transformations.  
- A well-organized rendering pipeline, including updates at a defined interval.  
- Easy integration of further shapes, lighting techniques, or user controls.  

This foundation enables experimentation with various 3D forms—ranging from cubes to fractal-based constructs—while supporting robust transformations, real-time animation, and potential future enhancements like lighting or interactive input.
